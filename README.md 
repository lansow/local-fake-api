# Fake API Builder Project

## Project Overview

A powerful local API simulation tool built with:
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Material UI
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic API endpoint creation
  - Support for all HTTP methods (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
  - Custom JSON response configuration
  - Item-level access endpoints
  - Beautiful Material UI interface

## Technical Implementation
